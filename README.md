# tarningen
This is a Wordpress theme created for a gaming store.

<h1>Tarningen</h1>

<h3>Developing</h3>

<p>The theme is created by me, Alexander Midjich. For developing the theme I have worked with plain html, css and some javascript. I have used a clean wordpress theme from http://underscores.me, just to get the necessay files for a wordpress theme to work.</p>

<p>Plug-ins that I have used for this theme is:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Advanced custom fields</li>
 <li>Custom post types</li>
 <li>WpForms</li>
 <li>compatibility</li>
</ul>

<p>This theme works on desktop, mobiles and tablets. For desktop I have tested it on chrome, firefox, IE, Edge and Safari</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>This is a single page application where the store basicly wants to display information about their store and what is happening. The store is very active on social media and ususaly post all their news there, therefore I linked their facebook feed to the page. I have also used a google calender so the store can write down all their activities there. </p>
